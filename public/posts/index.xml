      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-journey-through-the-lfx-linux-kernel-mentorship-program&#34;&gt;My Journey Through the LFX Linux Kernel Mentorship Program&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first decided to apply for the Linux Foundation&amp;rsquo;s LFX kernel mentorship program, I knew it would be tough. At the beginning, there were 12 tasks I had to complete to show I understood the basics of kernel development and to get accepted into the program. They helped me understand what I was getting into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that the mentorship is almost over, I can say this experience changed how I think about working with the Linux kernel. While I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about my specific code contributions later, I wanted to first share the learning journey itself and the resources that made it possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
